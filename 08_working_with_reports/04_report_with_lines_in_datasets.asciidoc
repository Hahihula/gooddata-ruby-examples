=== Creating a report which counts records in all the datasets
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
We've shown how to compute records in all project's datasets already in a separate recipe. Here we are going to use the same scenario to demonstrate on fly report creation and execution

==== Solution

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  GoodData.with_project('project_id') do |project|
    bp = project.blueprint
    anchors = bp.datasets.map {|d| [d, d.anchor]}
    ids = anchors.map do |d, a|
      a.nil? ? GoodData::Model.identifier_for(d.to_hash, type: :anchor_no_label) : GoodData::Model.identifier_for(d.to_hash, a)
    end
    attributes = ids.pmap {|id| project.attributes(id)}
    puts project.compute_report(left: attributes.map(&:create_metric))
  end
end

==== Discussion
Currently the API is not ideal and the recipe depends on user not messing with identifiers of anchors (connection_points) in case they are without labels.
