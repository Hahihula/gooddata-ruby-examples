=== Creating Report that Counts Records in All Datasets
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
Occasionally you need to know how many rows there are in each dataset.

==== Solution

This is surprisingly difficult to do in GoodData UI but it is simple with SDK. Here we are going to create the necessary metrics on the fly through inspection of a blueprint. Then we will create a report that will contain those metrics and compute it.

# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  GoodData.with_project('project_id') do |project|
    bp = project.blueprint

    # let's grab anchor on each dataset. Anchor is a special attribute on each dataset
    # this attribute defines the grain of the dataset if we "count" it we will get the number of lines
    # in the dataset
    anchors = bp.datasets.map(&:anchor)

    # As is explained in Blueprint section. Objects in blueprint are project agnostic.
    # Let's find corresponding attribute object in specific project
    attributes = anchors.pmap { |anchor| anchor.in_project(project) }

    # Lets create a report on the fly that is going to have the metrics in the rows
    # Take note that this is a real report on the platform that could be saved and alter reused
    puts project.compute_report(left: attributes.map(&:create_metric))

    # This might result into something like this
    #
    # [                                                            |   Values   ]
    # [count of Records of timeline                                | 0.7306E4   ]
    # [count of Activity                                           | 0.61496E6  ]
    # [count of Opportunity                                        | 0.85171E6  ]
    # [count of Product                                            | 0.5E1      ]
  end
end
