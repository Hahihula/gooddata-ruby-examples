=== Exporting report results
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to export the report from GoodData into one of the typical formats for further processing or presentation.

==== Solution

There are a simple way how to export a report from gooddata

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  GoodData.with_project('project_id') do |project|
    result = project.reports('report_identifier').export(:csv)
    puts result
  end
end

----

===== Discussion

There are more formats supported and either of `:csv, :xls, :xlsx or :pdf` should work.

The export returns the actual data so if you would like to have them stored into a file the responsibility is on you.

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  GoodData.with_project('project_id') do |project|
    report = project.reports('report_identifier')
    File.open('export.csv', 'wb') { |f| f.write(report.export(:csv)) }
  end
end
