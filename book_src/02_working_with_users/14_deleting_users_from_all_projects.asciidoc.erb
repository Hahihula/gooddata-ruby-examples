=== Deleting users from all projects
by Eliot Towb, Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to remove one user from all projects.

==== Solution

This script should remove user from all projects. There are couple of things you need to keep in mind though.

- This deletes user only from projects where you have access to
- If you are not admin in particular project the user will not be deleted from that particular project

<%= render_ruby 'src/02_working_with_users/delete_users_from_projects.rb' %>
