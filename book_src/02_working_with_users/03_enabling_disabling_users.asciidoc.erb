=== Enabling and Disabling Users
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You need to enable or disable users in a project.

==== Prerequisites
You have to have a user who is an admin in a project you would like to disable users in.

==== Solution

Disable and enable particular user in GoodData project

<%= render_ruby 'src/02_working_with_users/enable_disable.rb' %>

Disable all users in GoodData project

<%= render_ruby 'src/02_working_with_users/enable_disable_all.rb' %>

If you want to keep more than one user you can do something like this

<%= render_ruby 'src/02_working_with_users/enable_disable_all_except_some.rb' %>

==== Discussion

As you can see from the above examples possibilities are endless and you can easily enable or disable users just by correctly prepare the array of users to work with by using regular methods on arrays.
