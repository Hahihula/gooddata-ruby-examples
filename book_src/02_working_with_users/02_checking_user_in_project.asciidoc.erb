=== Checking User Membership in Project
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to see if a user is part of a project.

==== Prerequisites
You have to have a user who is an admin of an organization. If you don't have the organization admin account, please contact your primary GoodData contact person or GoodData support (e-mail support@gooddata.com).

==== Solution

<%= render_ruby 'src/02_working_with_users/checking_user_in_project.rb' %>

==== Discussion

You can ask on membership not just by login but also check an object. This might be useful especially if you check a user from several projects.
