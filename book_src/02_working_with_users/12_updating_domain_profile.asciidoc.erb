=== Updating a User in Organization 
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have users in your organization but some of those have incorrect or outdated information and need update

==== Prerequisites
You have to have a user who is an admin of an organization. If you don't have the organization admin account, please contact your primary GoodData contact person or GoodData support (e-mail support@gooddata.com). You have an organization populated with user. If you don't take a look at the recipe above (Adding user to organization)

==== Solution

Here we are updating an sso provider but you can update almost any property of a user.
