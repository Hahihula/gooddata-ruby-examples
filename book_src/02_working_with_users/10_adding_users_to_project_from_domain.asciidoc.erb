=== Adding Users from Organization to Multiple Projects 
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to add a users to project programmatically. You already have all the user profiles created in your organization (domain). You potentially have many projects that you would like to populate.

==== Prerequisites
You have to have a user who is an admin of an organization. If you don't have the organization admin account, please contact your primary GoodData contact person or GoodData support (e-mail support@gooddata.com). You have an organization populated with user. If you don't take a look at the recipe above (Adding user to organization)

We assume that you have a file with details which users should be added to a project. The file has to contain three pieces of information. Who you would like to add to a project, role that the user should take on in that project and which project he should be added to. The headers we used are defaults. If you have different ones you will have to do some mangling. Example of how to do that can be found in recipe adding_users_to_domain.

==== Solution

Sometimes the case might be that you would like to add users to a slew of projects in one go. Let's illustrate this on one example. Let's imagine that you have a file like this

    pid,login,role
    asl50ejow6bzp97i9pxlbcm3vkuvzQ72,john@example.com,admin

<%= render_ruby 'src/02_working_with_users/users_to_multiple_projects.rb' %>

What this does is to reads the users groups them according to a project and then adds them to the project. It reads all the users into memory but this should be ok for typical situations of thousands users. Note that we are not getting a project dynamically for each group of users. All the notes for whitelist apply as well.
