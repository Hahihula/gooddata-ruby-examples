=== Loading Multiple Data Sets to Project
by Tomas Korcak

==== Problem
You would like to load multiple data sets into project at once.

==== Solution

The GoodData platform supports loading multiple datasets from a set of CSV files in a single task.
In addition to loading a single CSV at a time, you can now upload your CSV files,
provide a JSON manifest file, and then execute the data load through a single API call.
This method is particularly useful if your project contains many datasets,
uses incremental data loading, or requires a long time to synchronize data.
