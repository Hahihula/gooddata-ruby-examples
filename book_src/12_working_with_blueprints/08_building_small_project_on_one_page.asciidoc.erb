=== Creating Project in One Page of Code
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to create the whole project from code for whatever reason.

==== Prerequisites
You have a provisioning token for project creation

==== Solution
What we will do is to create a simple project with 4 datasets. Load couple of line of data create a simple report and invite 2 other people to it. All this will fit on one page of code. Let's get to it.

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/building_small_project_on_one_page.rb' %>
