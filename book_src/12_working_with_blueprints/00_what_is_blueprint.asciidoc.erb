=== What is blueprint

Before we delve into examples involving blueprints let's talk a moment what a blueprint is and what is a difference between blueprint and model when we talk about them at Gooddata.

They mean the same thing but they are representing it in a different way and they live at different places. Both of them define a model of analytic application. 

The main difference is the fact that when we talk about model we mean a specific instance of a project which has specific instance of model with all its attributes and facts that live at GoodData platform. Each field has a URI and object_id and you can query it using the platform API. You can also ask questions like "What object in the model has object_id 1532?" or "Can you give me a link to dataset 'users' in the model?". 

When we talk about blueprint on the other hand we mean the abstract prescription that tells us how to create the model. Blueprint does not contain many of the details most prominently object_ids and URIs and strictly speaking each time you use blueprint to create a model those things might be different. When a model is created from blueprint as a sideffect all the URIs and id are created. 

So what are the benefits of the blueprint you might ask? Blueprint was specifically designed so you can have a description of the model that can live outside of GoodData platform. It has textual representation which you can commit into git and work with it in a programmatic way. Second it is intended that the many projects are created from one blueprint.
