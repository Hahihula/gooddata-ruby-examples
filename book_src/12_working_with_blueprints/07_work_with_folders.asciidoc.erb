=== Working with Folders
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to use folders for organizing your project's model 

==== Solution
By default all the attributes and facts are automatically assigned a folder based on it's dataset name. This name is either generated from the dataset's name or title (if defined). You can override this default and specify your own folder for any field.

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/folders.rb' %>

==== Discussion
Folders are not removed. If you would publish a model that doesn't contain an existing folder, the folder isn't autyomatically removed (it is empty).
