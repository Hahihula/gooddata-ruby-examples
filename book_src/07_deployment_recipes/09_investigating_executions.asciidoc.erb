=== Investigating Executions
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have large amount of projects and would like to investigate their execution. The administration UI is not necessarily helpful as its overview UI can hide some failures, there is too much too go through by hand etc.

==== Solution

Let's have a look at couple of scenarios. First let's investigate executions inside one project regardless of which schedule it was triggered by. Let's assume first that we are just looking for any executions that failed for that particular project. We will print the date when it happened sorted in ascending order.

<%= render_ruby 'src/07_deployment_recipes/schedule_investigation_1.rb' %>

Now imagine that you are looking for executions executed by a particular schedule.

<%= render_ruby 'src/07_deployment_recipes/schedule_investigation_2.rb' %>

Lets' make it even more specific and let's look for a specific term in the error message. Let's say that "unsynchronized" is the word we are looking for.

<%= render_ruby 'src/07_deployment_recipes/schedule_investigation_3.rb' %>

Sometimes the error does not manifest itself in the error message directly and you need to look into logs. Take note that in both last cases we are getting the log and the error message as a string so you have full power of ruby to process it. Here we are using regular expressions which by itself gives you significant power but you can go even deeper if you need.

<%= render_ruby 'src/07_deployment_recipes/schedule_investigation_4.rb' %>

Last example we will show is just a small extension. Imagine you would like to perform the same analysis on all projects in your account. This is usually the case since these type of analysis executions become exponentially more useful with growing number of executions or projects you need to investigate.

<%= render_ruby 'src/07_deployment_recipes/schedule_investigation_5.rb' %>
