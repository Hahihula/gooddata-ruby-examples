=== Adding a schedule to a deployed process
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have a process deployed but you would like to add a schedule to it so the process is executed regularly

==== Solution
You can easily add a time based schedule to any process. There are couple of advantages to a schedule as compared to a process. Schedule executions are logged and logs are kept around for some time (~10 days). Also schedule keeps list of parameters so you create it once and you do not need to care about them anymore.
