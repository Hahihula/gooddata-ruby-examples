=== Visualizing executions
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You successfully mudularized your ETL into several modules you orchestrated. The problem is that it is hard to visualize the order of execution from the Data Administration console.

==== Solution

There are plethora of very useful libraries that you can use in conjunction with GoodData SDK. One of those is Graphviz that is a C library but it has bindings to almost every language including Ruby. Graphviz is a visualization library and one of the features is visualizing Direct Acycclic Graphs which is exactly what an execution of several schedules bascially is.

As a prerequisite you have to install both http://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz] and https://github.com/glejeune/Ruby-Graphviz[Graphviz ruby bindings]. I leave this as a exercise for the reader because this might be a little bit difficult and unfortuntely is different for every platform. If you encounter any errors try googling them or shoot us a message on github or support
