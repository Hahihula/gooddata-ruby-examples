=== Visualizing executions
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You successfully modularized your ETL into several orchestrated modules. The problem is that it is hard to visualize the order of execution from the Data Administration console.

==== Solution

There are plethora of very useful libraries that you can use in conjunction with GoodData SDK. One of those is Graphviz that is a C library but it has bindings to almost every language including Ruby. Graphviz is a visualization library and one of the features allows visualization of Direct Acyclic Graphs which is exactly what an execution of several schedules basically is.

As a prerequisite you must install both http://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz] and https://github.com/glejeune/Ruby-Graphviz[Graphviz ruby bindings]. This is user dependent as installation is different for every platform. If you encounter any errors try googling them or shoot us a message on GitHub or support.
