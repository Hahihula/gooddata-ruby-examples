=== Redeploying Existing Process
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to redeploy a CloudConnect or Ruby process to GoodData platform.

==== Solution
SDK provides means for redeploying a process (with a new updated content). All you have to do is to get a handle on the process. Here we are using a process id to identify the process that we want to redeploy. You can use any other way to identify the process to redeploy. Take note that the same deployment rules as in `project.deploy_process` apply.
