=== Registering a notification email
by Vo Ha Tien

==== Problem
When executing a process, obtaining up-to-date information about the status is difficult.

==== Solution

Register a notification rule on a process. You can configure notification rules to send an email whenever the defined conditions are met.

The basic events are: GoodData::Subscription::PROCESS_SUCCESS_EVENT, GoodData::Subscription::PROCESS_FAILED_EVENT, GoodData::Subscription::PROCESS_SCHEDULED_EVENT, GoodData::Subscription::PROCESS_STARTED_EVENT. If you need to define your own special event, visit https://developer.gooddata.com/article/creating-custom-notification-events[creating custom notification events]

You can also add special variables to provide more information in the email. These can be used in the subject or email body.

<%= render_ruby 'src/07_deployment_recipes/add_notification_rule.rb' %>

You can also list all notification rules of a process and re-configure or delete the existing notification rule

<%= render_ruby 'src/07_deployment_recipes/modify_notification_rule.rb' %>

When registering a notification rule, GoodData will automatically create a channel for each email target if it's not exist. You can manually create a channel

<%= render_ruby 'src/07_deployment_recipes/channel_configuration_1.rb' %>

You can list all channels, re-configure or delete the existing channel

<%= render_ruby 'src/07_deployment_recipes/channel_configuration_2.rb' %>
