=== Deploying a process programmatically
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to deploy a CloudConnect or Ruby process to GoodData platform.

==== Solution
SDK allows you to deploy a process. Just point it to a file, directory or a zipped archive and that will be deployed.
Below is an example of CloudConnect process deployment. When deploying CloudConnect processes you typically want to take the whole folder structure of a CloudConnect project and deploy it. So you will want to pass either path to the root folder of the structure or you can zip it first and pass just a path to the zip archive. The below example points to the root folder of a CloudConnect project.

<%= render_ruby 'src/07_deployment_recipes/deploy_process.rb' %>

By default the process is deployed as a CloudConnect process. You can deploy as other types by providing specific type (CloudConnect is the only one generally available).

<%= render_ruby 'src/07_deployment_recipes/deploy_process_with_type.rb' %>

This also shows you how to deploy a single file.
