=== Updating report definition
by Tomas Korcak

==== Problem
You have report and you want to update report definition in easy way. Perhaps you need to modify multiple reports in one or more projects. 

==== Solution

Use the Report#update_definition with block argument in following way.


<%= render_ruby 'src/08_working_with_reports/update_report_definition_immutable.rb' %>

==== Discussion

Specify :new_definition => false if you do want to update the latest report definition instead of creating new one. New definition flag is true by default.

<%= render_ruby 'src/08_working_with_reports/update_report_definition.rb' %>
