=== Creating Report that Counts Records in All Datasets
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
We've shown how to compute records in all project's datasets already in a separate recipe. Here we are going to use the same scenario to demonstrate on fly report creation and execution

==== Solution

<%= render_ruby 'src/08_working_with_reports/report_lines_count.rb' %>

==== Discussion
Currently the API is not ideal and the recipe depends on user not messing with identifiers of anchors (connection_points) in case they are without labels.
