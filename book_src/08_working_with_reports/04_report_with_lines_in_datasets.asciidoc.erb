=== Creating Report that Counts Records in All Datasets
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
Occasionally you need to know how many rows there are in each dataset.

==== Solution

This is surprisingly difficult to do in GoodData UI but it is simple with SDK. Here we are going to create the necessary metrics on the fly through inspection of a blueprint. Then we will create a report that will contain those metrics and compute it.
