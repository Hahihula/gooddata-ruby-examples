=== You would like to create a report which counts lines of all the datasets
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
As stated in another recipe, creating a report that counts lines in a dataset is a tedious and difficult task in UI. Why not automating it?

==== Solution

<%= render_ruby 'src/08_working_with_reports/report_lines_count.rb' %>

==== Discussion

Currently the API is not ideal and the recipe depends on user not messing with identifiers of anchors (connection_points) in case they are without labels.
