by Petr Gadorek

==== Solution

There are a simple way how to export a report in raw form from gooddata

[source,ruby]

# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  GoodData.with_project('project_id') do |project|
 	filename = Dir::Tmpname.make_tmpname([File.join(Dir.pwd, Dir::Tmpname.tmpdir, 'raw_export'), '.csv'], nil)
    project.reports('report_identifier').export_raw(filename)
  end
end
