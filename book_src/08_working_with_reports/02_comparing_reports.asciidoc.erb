=== You would like to compare reports across projects
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You created a new version of a project. You made some changes to the reports and you would like to verify that the report is still computing the same numbers.

==== Solution

<%= render_ruby 'src/08_working_with_reports/comparing_reports.rb' %>

==== Discussion

If there is more reports this can obviously take a lot of time so it would be nice if you could do computation or reports in parallel and not sequentially. Imagine we have a list of reports that should be checked tagged by tag `to_check`. Let's rewrite previous code snippet to be parallel friendly.

<%= render_ruby 'src/08_working_with_reports/comparing_reports_parallel.rb' %>
