=== Exporting report results
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to export the report from GoodData into one of the typical formats for further processing or presentation.

==== Solution

There are a simple way how to export a report from gooddata

<%= render_ruby 'src/08_working_with_reports/exporting_a_report.rb' %>

===== Discussion

There are more formats supported and either of `:csv, :xls, :xlsx or :pdf` should work.

The export returns the actual data so if you would like to have them stored into a file the responsibility is on you.

<%= render_ruby 'src/08_working_with_reports/exporting_a_report_to_file.rb' %>
