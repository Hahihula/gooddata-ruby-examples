=== Cloning project in between organizations
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to clone project to a different organization

==== Solution
Usually you would be happy using `project.clone` but sometimes you need more granularity in controlling who is doing what. In this recipe we are going to explain what is happening when you clone a project and how you can leverage the lower level API.

When the project clone is done SDK actually orchestrates couple of calls together
1) Exports a project, obtaining a token of the export package which is stored at GoodData
2) Creates an empty project
3) Imports the package (from step 1) into a freshly created project from step 2

All these 3 calls are async by default so SDK makes sure that things happen at the right time and makes cloning synchronous.

Sometimes more granular things are need for example when you need to clone a project to different organization. This means that clone would not work since you cannot have one user in 2 organizations. We decided to expose the methods to allow you doing the three steps above so anyone can mix and match.
