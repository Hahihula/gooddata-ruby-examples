=== Creating Empty Project using specific environment.
by Tomas Korcak

==== Problem
You want to create a project programmatically using specific environment. The TESTING projects are not backed up and may be discarded during a platform maintenance.

.Environments
* PRODUCTION _(DEFAULT)_
* DEVELOPMENT
* TESTING

Note that the environment names are case sensitive.

==== Solution

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

client = GoodData.connect
project = client.create_project(title: 'My project title', auth_token: 'PROJECT_CREATION_TOKEN', :environment => 'TESTING')

# after some time the project is created and you can start working with it
puts project.uri
puts project.environment # => 'TESTING'
