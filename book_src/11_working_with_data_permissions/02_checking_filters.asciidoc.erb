=== List Data Permissions

by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have a project that has the data permissions set up. You would like to review them.

==== Solution
There is no UI that would provide a good overview and API is a little crude but with help of SDK you can get around that.

<%= render_ruby 'src/11_working_with_data_filters/list_user_filters.rb' %>
