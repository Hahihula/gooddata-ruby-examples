=== Setting Data Permissions from CSV (row format)

by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to set adata permissions for multiple users. You have a CSV with two columns that associate user with a single data permssion's value. We'll use the same city example from the examples above.  

==== Solution
SDK offers couple of convenience features for doing this. Let's first recap what we need to set up a filter.

In this case we will be setting a simple data permission for the city label in form of following filter

  WHERE city IN ('San Francisco', 'Prague', 'Amsterdam')

* We need to know the label to filter. In our case this is the _city_ label
* We need to know the label's values. In our case these are (San Francisco, Prague, Amsterdam)
* We also need to know the user assigned with the filter. We'll use your account in the example (you may use any valid user).

Let's say we want to set up these specific values

[source]
----
['john.doe@example.com', 'San Francisco', 'Amsterdam']
['jane.doe@example.com', 'San Francisco', 'Prague']
----

We'll capture these data permissions in the following CSV (data.csv)

[source]
----
john.doe@example.com,San Francisco,Amsterdam
jane.doe@example.com,San Francisco,Prague,Berlin
----

Please note that the CSV format is different frpom the previous example. There are no headers because the file can have different number of columns on each line.

===== Preconditions
Several things has to be true for this code to work correctly

* All the users are members of the target project
* All the label's (city) values are present in the data loaded in the project
