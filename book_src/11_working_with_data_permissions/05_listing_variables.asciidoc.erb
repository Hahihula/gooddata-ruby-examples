=== List Variable Values

by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have variable in your project and you would like to see the values in a readable fashion.

==== Solution
SDK tries to hide the differences from Data Permissions so this recipe is analogy to <<List Data Permissions>> recipe.

<%= render_ruby 'src/11_working_with_data_filters/list_user_variable_values.rb' %>

Unlike the Data Permissions Variables has a concept of default value for the project. If a specific values is not provided for a user the project default is used. You can noticed these users to have "TRUE" as a value. The project value is marked as [PROJECT DEFAULT] in the output.
