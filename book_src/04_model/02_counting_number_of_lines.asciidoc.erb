=== Computing number of lines in a dataset
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
Very often there is a need to know how many lines there are in a dataset.

==== Solution
This is not so easy to do on UI. You basically have to find the main attribute on a dataset and then create a report. It is much easier to use SDK for a shortcut.

<%= render_ruby 'src/04_model/counting_lod.rb' %>
