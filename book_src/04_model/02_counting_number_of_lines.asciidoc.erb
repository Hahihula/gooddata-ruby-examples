=== Computing Dataset's Number of Records
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
Very often there is a need to know how many records there are in a dataset.

==== Solution
This is not so easy to do on UI. You basically have to find the dataset's connection point and then create a simple report with COUNT metric. SDK makes this very simple task.
