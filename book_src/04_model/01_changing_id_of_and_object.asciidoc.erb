=== Changing Object's Identifier
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You moved an attribute in your model and you would like to change the identifier for it to follow the naming convention.

==== Solution
You can change identifier on any object (e.g. dashboards, reports, metrics, attributes, facts etc.). Many tools rely on specific LDM object identifier's naming convention. So changing the identifier may be very handy for for enforcing the naming convention. For example when you move an attribute from one dataset to another, you may want to change it's identifier.
