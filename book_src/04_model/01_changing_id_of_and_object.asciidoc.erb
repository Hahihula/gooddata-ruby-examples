=== Changing identifier of and object
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You moved an attribute in your model and you would like to change the identifier so it follows the convention.

==== Solution
You can change identifier on any object not just parts of model like attribute or/and fact. But in case of objects that play part in a model are the ones where naming really matter because some tools rely on convention in the naming.
