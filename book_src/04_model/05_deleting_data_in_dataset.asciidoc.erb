=== Removing data from dataset(s)
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
Sometimes you need to get rid of the data in project. SDK allows to do it quickly and elegantly.

==== Solution
What happens underneath is that you can call a MAQL expression along the lines of

  SYNCHRONIZE {dataset.users};

for each dataset you would like to clear. You can achieve the same like this.

<%= render_ruby 'src/04_model/deleting_data.rb' %>
