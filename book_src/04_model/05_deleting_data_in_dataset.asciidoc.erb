=== Removing Data
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
Sometimes you need to delete all data from a dataset.

==== Solution
SDK calls the MAQL SYNCHRONUIZE command on the dataset

  SYNCHRONIZE {dataset.users};

for each dataset you would like to clear. You can achieve the same like this.

<%= render_ruby 'src/04_model/deleting_data.rb' %>
