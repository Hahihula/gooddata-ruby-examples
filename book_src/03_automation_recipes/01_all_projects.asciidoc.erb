=== Perform an operation on multiple projects
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You already know how to do many things but now you would like to do the same thing on many projects at once.

==== Solution
The basis of the solution is pretty simple. We need to iterate over projects and perform an operation on each of them.

Lets illustrate this on a simple example. We will compile a list of all reports from user's projects that have been changed since last week by somebody from GoodData. If there is more than one revision in a report we'll assume that the report is changing frequently and create a scheduled email for QA to validate the report. We'll also tag all reports with "to_be_checked" tag to make their life a little easier.

This is a lot to do. Let's try to break the tasks down to smaller pieces.

===== Work with many projects

<%= render_ruby 'src/03_automation_recipes/with_many_projects.rb' %>

===== Select specific reports

<%= render_ruby 'src/03_automation_recipes/select_reports.rb' %>

===== Remove tag

<%= render_ruby 'src/03_automation_recipes/remove_tag.rb' %>

===== Add tag

<%= render_ruby 'src/03_automation_recipes/add_tag.rb' %>

===== Schedule

<%= render_ruby 'src/03_automation_recipes/schedule.rb' %>

===== Full example - all pieces together

<%= render_ruby 'src/03_automation_recipes/perform_an_operation_on_multiple_projects.rb' %>

==== Discussion
Please note that the reports in projects are processed sequentially (one after another).
