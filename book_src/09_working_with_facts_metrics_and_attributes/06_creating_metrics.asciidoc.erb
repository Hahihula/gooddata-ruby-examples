=== Creating Metrics

by Zdenek Svoboda

==== Problem
You want to create advanced MAQL metric.

==== Prerequisites
You have to have existing project with model and data loaded.

==== Solution

<%= render_ruby 'src/09_working_with_facts_metrics_and_attributes/metric_from_maql.rb' %>

==== Discussion
Please note that the MAQL statement uses three ways how to reference the underlying objects (e.g. facts or metrics that are part of the MAQL statement)

* _#"Amount"_ for referencing the fact (or metric) via its name (title)
* _![fact.salary.amount]_ for referencing the fact (or metric) via its identifier
* _[/gdc/md/ptbedvc1841r4obgptywd2mzhbwjsfyr/obj/223]_ for referencing the fact (or metric) via its uri
