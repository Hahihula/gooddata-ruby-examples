=== Working with segments
by Tomas Svarovsky

This is WIP. It should not be released publicly until we are ready

==== Problem
You would like to spin up a segment and project with livecycle menagement support.

==== Solution

You can use Lifecycle management API to conveniently spin up projects and distribute reports and ETL for large number of customers. First let's define some terminology.

Organization - Organization is an object that represents your organiation at gooddata. It contains information about your users, your whitelabeling data etc. All created projects are assigned to this particular organization.

Segment - When you are working with larger number of projects (each project for a customer) it is common to provide different tiers of customers different user experience.

Client - Is referring to a combination of a project assigned to a certain segment identified by an id provided by your customer. Usually is synonym to a customer's project but in rare circumstances one customer can have multiple projects (thus having several clients).

Having defined some terminology we present code that will set up a segment with master project and create a client with a clone
