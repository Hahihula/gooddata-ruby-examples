=== Working with data products
by Jakub Mahnert

==== Problem
You would like to encapsule multiple segments into a data product for better granularity.

==== Solution

This solution is based on the terminology and examples presented in chapter regarding <<01_wip_segments.asciidoc,Segments>>.

This code will do several things:

- sets up a segment in the legacy way, referencing no dataproduct
- sets up another segment as a part of a dataproduct
- shows that the segments are only included in the specific dataproduct that was used to create them

<%= render_ruby 'src/13_working_with_lifecycle/data_product.rb' %>
