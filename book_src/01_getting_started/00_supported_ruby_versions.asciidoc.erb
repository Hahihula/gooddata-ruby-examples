=== Supported Ruby Versions
by Tomas Korcak

==== Problem
You want to know which Ruby versions are supported by SDK.

==== Solution

Here is a list of supported ruby versions.

- Ruby 1.9.3
- Ruby 2.0
- Ruby 2.1
- Ruby 2.2
- JRuby with Oracle Java 1.8.0.51
- JRuby with OpenJDK 1.8.0.51

JRuby with latest version of Java (1.8.0.60) is not supported because of breaking changes in SSL.
Using latest JRuby with Java higher than 1.8.0.51 will cause failing uploads to WebDav.
We will support latest Java as soon as these breaking changes will get fixed or workaround will be found.
