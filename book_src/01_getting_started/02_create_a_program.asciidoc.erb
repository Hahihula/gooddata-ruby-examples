=== Scripting 
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You created a program by building it up in an interactive manner but now you would like to put it into a file to be able to run it

==== Solution

Let's assume that your fantastic code that you have is fairly simple. You would like to print the title of the project. So the session looks something like this

  project_live_session: puts project.title
  "My project Test (2)"
  => nil

Not too fancy but it is enough to help us illustrate couple of points. First you need to save your code to a file. Go ahead take your favorite text editor and create a new file and put your code into it so it looks like this

  puts client.projects

Go ahead and save it and call it 'my_first_sdk_program.rb'. Do not execute because it would not work now. Let's add couple more things.

Jack in does couple of things for you so you can be productive quickly but we have to handle them ourselves in a program.

* Loads Automation SDK libraries
* It logs you in and provides you the client as a `client` variable
* It jacks into a project and provides you the project as a `project` variable. If you were wondering why the `project.title` worked in the interactive session in the first place since we never defined `project` this is why.

We can easily do the same things with these 3 lines of code respectively. So add them to the file so the end result looks like this.

  require 'gooddata'

  client = GoodData.connect('username', 'pass')
  project = client.projects('project_id')
  puts project.title

Done. Save it.

Now you can run it by using this command

  ruby my_first_sdk_program.rb
