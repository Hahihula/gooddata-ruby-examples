=== Executing SQL Queries on ADS

by Patrick McConlogue

==== Problem
You have a SQL query you would like to run on ADS (Vertica) programatically with Ruby.

==== Solution
Using the GoodData DataWarehouse GEM you have several ways to execute SQL on the platform. Note, interfacing with ADS requires the use of JRuby.

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata_datawarehouse'

dwh = GoodData::Datawarehouse.new('you@gooddata.com', 'yourpass', 'your ADS instance id')

dwh.execute('ALTER TABLE my_table ADD COLUMN col3 INTEGER')

----

When running results that process or select use this method to computer the data in the enumerator.

[source,ruby]
----

dwh.execute_select('SELECT * FROM my_table ORDER BY col1') do |row|
	puts row[:col1]
end
