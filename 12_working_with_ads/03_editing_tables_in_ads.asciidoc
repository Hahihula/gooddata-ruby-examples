=== Editing Tables In ADS

by Patrick McConlogue

==== Problem
Using Ruby, you would like to edit, rename, validate existence, or delete a table.

==== Solution
With the GoodData DataWarehouse gem you are given many methods to work with tables. Note, interfacing with ADS requires the use of JRuby.

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata_datawarehouse'

dwh = GoodData::Datawarehouse.new('you@gooddata.com', 'yourpass', 'your ADS instance id')

# Check if a table exists?
dwh.table_exists?('my_table') # BOOL

# Rename a table
dwh.rename_table('my_table', 'my_new_table')

# Drop table
dwh.drop_table('my_new_table')
