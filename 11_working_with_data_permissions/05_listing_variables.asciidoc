=== List Variable Values

by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have variable in your project and you would like to see the values in a readable fashion.

==== Solution
SDK tries to hide the differences from Data Permissions so this recipe is analogy to <<List Data Permissions>> recipe.

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

# fill this in
VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER = 'variable_identifier'
PROJECT_ID = 'project_id'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  GoodData.with_project(PROJECT_ID) do |project|
    var = project.variables(VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER)
    var.values.pmap do |var|
      owner = var.related.class == GoodData::Project ? "[PROJECT DEFAULT]" : var.related.login rescue nil
      [owner, var.pretty_expression]
    end
  end
end

Unlike the Data Permissions Variables has a concept of default value for the project. If a specific values is not provided for a user the project default is used. You can noticed these users to have "TRUE" as a value. The project value is marked as [PROJECT DEFAULT] in the output.
