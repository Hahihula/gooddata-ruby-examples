=== List Data Permissions

by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have a project that has the data permissions set up. You would like to review them.

==== Solution
There is no UI that would provide a good overview and API is a little crude but with help of SDK you can get around that.

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  GoodData.with_project('project_id') do |project|
    project.data_permissions.pmap {|filter| 
      if !filter.related 
      # filter is not assigned to any user, 'nil' is returned
        [nil, filter.pretty_expression]
      elsif filter.related.respond_to?(:login) 
      # filter is assigned to single user, expect array of length 1
        [[filter.related.login], filter.pretty_expression]
      else
      # filter is probably assigned to multiple users, array of logins is returned
        [filter.related.map!(&:login), filter.pretty_expression] 
      end
    }
  end
end
