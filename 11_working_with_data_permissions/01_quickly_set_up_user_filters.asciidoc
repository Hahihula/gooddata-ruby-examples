=== Setting Up Simple Data Permission

by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to set a data permission (user filter or MUF filter) for one or two users. 

==== Solution
SDK offers couple of convenience features for doing this. Let's first recap what we need to set up a data permission filter. We'll be setting a simple filter along these lines

  WHERE city IN (San Francisco, Prague, Amsterdam)

* We need to know the label to filter. In our case this is the _city_ label
* We need to know the label's values. In our case these are (San Francisco, Prague, Amsterdam)
* We also need to know the user assigned with the filter. We'll use your account in the example (you may use any valid user).

Although we present this as an executable script this is something that is often done interactively. 
So do not fear to jack in to a project and follow along.

# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  GoodData.with_project('project_id') do |project|
    # First let's grab an attribute
    attribute = project.attributes('attr.region.city')
    # to set up a value we need a specific label
    # if the attribute has only one label, you can easily grab it by calling #primary_label
    label = attribute.primary_label
    # if a label has multiple labels, you can select the correct one like this
    # label = attribute.label_by_name('City Name')
    # Let's construct filters we are going to set up
    # We will do it for two hypothetical users
    filters = [
      ['john.doe@example.com', label.uri, 'San Francisco', 'Amsterdam']
      ['jane.doe@example.com', label.uri, 'San Francisco', 'Prague']
    ]
    # Obvious question might be how do you know that the values are correct
    # you can find out like this label.value?('Amsterdam')
    # Let's now update the project
    project.add_data_permissions(filters)
  end
end
