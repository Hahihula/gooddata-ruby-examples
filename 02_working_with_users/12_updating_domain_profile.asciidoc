=== Updating a User in Organization 
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have users in your organization but some of those have incorrect or outdated information and need update

==== Prerequisites
You have to have a user who is an admin of an organization. If you don't have the organization admin account, please contact your primary GoodData contact person or GoodData support (e-mail support@gooddata.com). You have an organization populated with user. If you don't take a look at the recipe above (Adding user to organization)

==== Solution

Here we are updating an sso provider but you can update almost any property of a user.

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

client = GoodData.connect
domain = client.domain 'organization_name'
u = domain.find_user_by_login('john@gooddata.com')
u.sso_provider = 'a_provider'
domain.update_user(u)
