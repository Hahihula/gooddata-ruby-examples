=== Adding user to project from organization (domain)
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have users added in organization (domain). You would like to add them into the project.

==== Prerequisites
You have to have a user who is an admin of an organization. If you don't have the organization admin account, please contact your primary GoodData contact person or GoodData support (e-mail support@gooddata.com).
Works only with 0.6.12 and higher

==== Solution

[source,ruby]
----
require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |client|

  # Get your domain ..
  domain = client.domain('custom_domain')
  project = client.projects('project_id')

  # Let's get all users except of ourselves
  users_to_add = domain.users.reject { |u| u.login != client.user.login }

  # Let's add all as viewer
  users_to_add.each { |u| project.add_user(u, 'Viewer', domain: domain) }

end
