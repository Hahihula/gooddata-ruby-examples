=== Inviting Users to Project
by Tomas Korcak

==== Problem
You need to invite a user into project.

==== Prerequisites
You have to have a user who is an admin of an organization. If you don't have the organization admin account, please contact your primary GoodData contact person or GoodData support (e-mail support@gooddata.com). 

==== Solution

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

client = GoodData.connect
project = client.projects('project_pid')

project.invite('joe@example.com', 'admin', 'Hey Joe, look at this.')


----


==== Discussion
Invitation can be sent by any administrator. Invited user receives invitation e-mail with invitation confirmation. If you want to add user into a project  without the e-mail and confirmation, please consult the recipe Adding users to Project.
