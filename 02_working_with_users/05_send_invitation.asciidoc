=== Invite user to project
by Tomas Korcak

==== Problem
You would like to add a user into project.

==== Prerequisites
You have to have a user who is an admin of an organization. If you don't have the organization admin account, please contact your primary GoodData contact person or GoodData support (e-mail support@gooddata.com). 

==== Solution

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection('user', 'password') do |client|
  GoodData.with_project('project_pid') do |project|
    project.invite('joe@example.com', 'admin', 'Hey Joe, look at this.')
  end
end
----


==== Discussion
Invitation can be sent by any administrator. It also means that the recipient will receive an email with instructions how to proceed. If you are interested in how to invite users without their knowledge (this is very useful for Powered By GoodData scenarios) see Recipe XX.
