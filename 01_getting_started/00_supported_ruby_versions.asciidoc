=== Supported Ruby Versions
by Tomas Korcak

==== Problem
You want to know which Ruby to use with the SDK.

==== Solution

Here is a list of supported ruby versions.

- Ruby 1.9.3
- Ruby 2.0
- Ruby 2.1
- Ruby 2.2
- JRuby with Oracle Java 1.8.0.51
- JRuby with OpenJDK 1.8.0.51

Unfortunately JRuby with latest version of Java (1.8.0.60) is not supported because of issues with SSL. Using latest JRuby with Java higher than 1.8.0.51 is going to cause network communication issues (WebDav authentication). We will support latest Java as soon as soon as these issues are resolved.
