=== Connecting to GoodData Platform with Super Secure Token (SST)
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You do not have credentials. You only have SST and would like to still make some requests.

==== Solution
A Super Secure Token is a token that allows to access you our APIs in a unrestricted manner without necessarily knowing the username and password. Take note that currently you do not have access to the whole API. Things like interacting with DSS and Staging Storage still need a username and password. This issue is currently being resolved.
First you need to have SST token. There are several ways how to obtain it. Here is one using SDK

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

client = GoodData.connect(login: 'user', password: 'password')
client.connection.sst_token

# Once you have the token, you can try to login and do something.

GoodData.with_connection(sst_token: 'sst_token') do |client|
  client.projects.each do |p|
    puts p.title
  end
end
----

==== Discussion

Never share the token with other people. It is the same thing as your login and password. You can do almost everything with it.
