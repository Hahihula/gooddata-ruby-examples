=== Logging
by Zdenek Svoboda

==== Problem
Your script doesn't work or throws a weird error. You want to see detailed logging information to understand what is going on. 

==== Solution

GoodData Ruby SDK uses the standard Ruby logger that you can use in standard way

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
GoodData.logger = logger
----

You can also use following abbreviated syntax for logging to standard output using DEBUG level 

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.logging_http_on
----

or using INFO level

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.logging_on
----

another option is to specify the debug level explicitly 

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.logging_on(Logger::DEBUG)
----

There are quite a few options to choose from. Feel free to use whatever you like the best.
