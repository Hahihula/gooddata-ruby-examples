=== Handling credentials when you log in to gooddata
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to write scripts that are sharable. Currently you either have to rely on ~/.gooddata file or put there the credentials by hand. This is error prone and you have to be careful so you do not share your passwords

==== Solution
There is fairly easy solution that you can use. If you recall correctly there is a way how you can log in into platform.

[source,ruby]
----
GoodData.connect(login: 'user', password: 'password')
----

This takes several types of parameters one of which is a hash of values. You can leverage that and read the hash from a file. There a many variants we are going to show 2 most popular ones, YAML and JSON.

===== JSON

Create a file that looks like this.

[source,json]
----
{
  "login" : "john@gooddata.com",
  "password" : "my_secret"
}
----

[source,ruby]
----
params = JSON.parse(File.read('/path/to/file))
client = GoodData.connect(params)
puts client.projects.count
----

===== YAML

Create a file that looks like this.

[source,yaml]
----
login: john@gooddata.com
password: my_secret
----

[source,ruby]
----
require 'yaml'

params = YAML.load(File.read('/path/to/file))
client = GoodData.connect(params)
puts client.projects.count
----
