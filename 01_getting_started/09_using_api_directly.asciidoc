=== Using APIs
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to interact with GoodData API directly

==== Solution
SDK provides you slew of well known methods that make this possible while shielding you from intricacies of keeping connection alive etc.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'gooddata'

client.get("/gdc/md/")

project_id = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'

client.delete("/gdc/projects/#{project_id}")
