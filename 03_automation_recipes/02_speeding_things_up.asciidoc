=== Parallel Processing
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You created the script. It works but it is slow. Let's have at one trick how to possibly make it faster.

==== Solution
Often if you look at the API the structure is orthogonal to your use case. For example you might need to invite user to many projects but the API has only an endpoint to invite a user to a single project. If you do something like

[source,ruby]
----
projects.map do |project|
  project.invite_user('john@example.com')
end
----

it will work but it will create as many requests as there are projects. The requests will be processed sequentially and this takes time. You can estimate this easily. Let's say we have 1000 projects and invitation request takes 500ms (half a second). This means it will take 500 seconds therefore almost 10 minutes.

The nice thing is that the requests for inviting user to each project are totally independent. You don't need a project invitation to finish before you invite the user to another project. So you can invoke multiple invitations at the same time. The following code invokes multiple invitations in parallel

[source,ruby]
----
projects.pmap do |project|
  project.invite_user('john@example.com')
end
----

We've just changed single letter. We are using pmap which stands for parallel map. It behaves exactly the same as map with one difference. The block for each item of the array runs in a separate thread. You do not need to think about it, it just happens faster. We have currently 20 threads reserved so it will run 20 times faster. In this case under 0.5 minutes.
