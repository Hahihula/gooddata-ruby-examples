=== Automated Data Distribution (ADD)
by Vo Ha Tien

==== Problem
You would like to upload data from the Data Warehouse to a workspace.

==== Solution
You must have the output stage associated with the workspace you need to upload data to.
An ADD process is created after associating the workspace with the output stage.

GoodData.with_connection do |client|
  GoodData.with_project('project_id') do |project|
    ads = client.create_datawarehouse(title: 'Test ADS', auth_token: 'ADS_CREATION_TOKEN')
    output_stage = project.create_output_stage(ads)
    puts output_stage.sql_diff
    add_process = project.add.process
  end
