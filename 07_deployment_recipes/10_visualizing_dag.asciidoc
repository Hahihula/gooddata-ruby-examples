=== Visualizing executions
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You successfully modularized your ETL into several orchestrated modules. The problem is that it is hard to visualize the order of execution from the Data Administration console.

==== Solution

There are plethora of very useful libraries that you can use in conjunction with GoodData SDK. One of those is Graphviz that is a C library but it has bindings to almost every language including Ruby. Graphviz is a visualization library and one of the features allows visualization of Direct Acyclic Graphs which is exactly what an execution of several schedules basically is.

As a prerequisite you must install both http://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz] and https://github.com/glejeune/Ruby-Graphviz[Graphviz ruby bindings]. This is user dependent as installation is different for every platform. If you encounter any errors try googling them or shoot us a message on GitHub or support.

    schedules = project.schedules

    nodes = project.processes.pmapcat { |p| p.schedules.map { |s| [s, "#{p.name}-#{s.name}"] } }
    edges = schedules.reject(&:time_based?).pmap {|s| ["#{s.after.process.name}-#{s.after.name}", "#{s.process.name}-#{s.name}"]}


    g = GraphViz.new(:G, :type => :digraph , :rankdir => 'TB')
    nodes.each { |s, n|
      node = g.add_nodes(n)
      node[:shape] = 'box'
      node[:label] = n + "\n#{s.cron}"
    }

    edges.each { |a, b| g.add_edges(a, b) }
    g.output(:png => "run_dag.png")

    # Now you can open it for example on mac by running this on terminal
    # open -a Preview run_dag.png
  end
