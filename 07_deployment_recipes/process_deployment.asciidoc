=== Working with a remote model
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to deploy a CludConnect graph or another process to GoodData platform.

==== Solution
SDK allows you to deploy a process. Just point it to a file or a zipped archive and that will be deployed.

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |client|
  project = GoodData.use('project_id')
  project.deploy_process('./path/to_cloud_connect_process.grf',
                         name: 'Test ETL Process')
end
----

By default the process is deployed as a CloudConnect process. You can deploy as other types by providing specific type.

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |client|
  project = GoodData.use('project_id')
  project.deploy_process('./path/to_cloud_connect_process.rb',
                         type: 'RUBY',
                         name: 'Test ETL Process')
end
---- 
 
==== Discussion

There are couple of different things you can deploy. In previous example you saw how to deploy a file. If you on the other hand point to a directory. It will be zipped and deployed as a whole.

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |client|
  project = GoodData.use('project_id')
  project.deploy_process('./path/to_cloud_connect_directory',
                         name: 'Test ETL Process')
end
