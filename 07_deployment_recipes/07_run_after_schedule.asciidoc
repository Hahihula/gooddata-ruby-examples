=== Run-After Scheduling 
by Zdenek Svoboda

==== Problem
You want to schedule a process to run upon successful completion of another process (schedule). This is also known as run-after triggered schedule.

==== Solution
If you use an existing schedule object instead of a cron expression in the create_schedule method, the scheduled process will be scheduled to execute upon successful completion of the passed schedule.

      name: "after_process")
	# Note passing the parent_schedule instead of a cron expression 
    process.create_schedule(parent_schedule, 'after_process.rb', params: { param1: 'a', param2: 'b' })
