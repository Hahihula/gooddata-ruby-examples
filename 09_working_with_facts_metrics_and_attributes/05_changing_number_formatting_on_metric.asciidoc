=== Changing Metric's Number Formatting

by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have a project and you would like to update formatting of all metrics programmatically. They are currently formatted for dollar values but you would like to change all formats to Euro.

==== Solution

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  GoodData.with_project('project_id') do |project|
    project.metrics.pmap do |metric|
      metric.content['format'] = metric.content['format'].gsub('$', 'â‚¬')
      metric.save
    end
  end
end
