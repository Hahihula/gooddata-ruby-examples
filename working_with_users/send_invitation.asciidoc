  require 'gooddata'

  username = 'svarovsky+gem_tester@gooddata.com'
  password = 'jindrisska'

  # Connect to platform using credentials
  puts "Connecting as #{username} ..."
  GoodData.connect username, password

  domain = GoodData::Domain['gooddata-tomas-svarovsky']
  users = domain.users

  pp users

  # And disconnect finally
  puts 'Disconnecting ...'
