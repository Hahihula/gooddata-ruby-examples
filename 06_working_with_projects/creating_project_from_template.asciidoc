=== Creating a project from template
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have a template created for you and you would like to spin a project from this template.

==== Warning
We highly recommend not to use templates unless you have a reason. We recommend combination of blueprints + master clones. They are much more flexible and predictable.

==== Solution

[source,ruby]
----
require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  project = GoodData::Project.create(title: 'New project',
                                     template: 'https://secure.gooddata.com/projectTemplates/SuperSoda/1/',
                                     auth_token: 'token')
end
