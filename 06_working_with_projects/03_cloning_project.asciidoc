require 'gooddata'

client = GoodData.connect
project = client.projects('project_pid')
cloned_project = project.clone(title: 'New title',
                               auth_token: 'token',
                               users: false,
                               data: true,
                               exclude_schedules: true)

==== Discussion
There are three options that you can specify. You can pick if you want to clone just metadata (e.g. attributes, facts, metrics reports, dashboards etc.) or also data (this is default). Also you can choose if you want to transfer all old project's users to the new project. No users are transferred by default. In the example above we explicitly specified the _users_ and _data_ optional parameters so you can see how it works. Setting the exclude_schedules to true causes scheduled emails to be omitted from the transfer.
