=== Removing data from dataset(s)
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
Sometimes you need to delete all data from a dataset.

==== Solution
SDK calls the MAQL SYNCHRONUIZE command on the dataset

  SYNCHRONIZE {dataset.users};

for each dataset you would like to clear. You can achieve the same like this.

[source,ruby]

# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  GoodData.with_project('project_pid') do |project|

    # You can select the dataset in several ways
    dataset = project.datasets.find {|d| d.title == 'Users'}
    dataset = project.datasets('dataset.users')
    dataset = project.datasets(345)
    # dataset.synchronize works as well
    dataset.delete_data
    
  end
end
