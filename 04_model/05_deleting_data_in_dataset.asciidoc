=== Removing data from dataset(s)
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
Sometimes you need to get rid of the data in project. SDK allows to do it quickly and elegantly.

==== Solution
What happens underneath is that you can call a MAQL expression along the lines of

  SYNCHRONIZE {dataset.users};

for each dataset you would like to clear. You can achieve the same like this.

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  project = GoodData.use('project_id')
  dataset = project.datasets.find {|d| d.title == 'Users'}
  dataset.delete_data # dataset.synchronize works as well
end
