=== Changing Object's Identifier
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You moved an attribute in your model and you would like to change the identifier for it to follow the naming convention.

==== Solution
You can change identifier on any object (e.g. dashboards, reports, metrics, attributes, facts etc.). Many tools rely on specific LDM object identifier's naming convention. So changing the identifier may be very handy for for enforcing the naming convention. For example lwhen you move an attribute from one dataset to another, you may want to change it's identifier.

require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection do |c|
  GoodData.with_project('project_pid') do |project|

    # We find the attribute we want to change
    # Lets list all attributes in the project
    # and print its title and identifier
    puts project.attributes.map {|a| [a.identifier, a.title]}

    # Let's pick one
    # Here I just pick the first one
    attribute = project.attributes.first

    # but you can also pick one by identifier. For example
    # attribute = project.attributes('attr.salesmem.country')
    # We have a look at the current value.
    # Let's say it is 'attr.users.region'
    puts attribute.identifier

    # We change the value
    attribute.identifier = 'attr.salesmen.region'
    attribute.save

    # If we refresh the value from server
    # we get a new value 'attr.salesmen.region'
    attribute.reload!
    puts attribute.identifier
    
  end
end
