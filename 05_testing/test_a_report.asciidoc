=== You want to test if report returns expected results
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You want to be sure that reports return expected results. This is a basis for delving later into test driven BI projects.

==== Solution

[source,ruby]
----
require 'gooddata'

GoodData.connect
GoodData.with_project('project_pid') do |project|
  report = project.report(32)
  result = report.execute
  fail "Report has unexpected result" unless result == [[1, 2, 3]]
end
